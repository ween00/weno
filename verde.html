          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Etsy:</b> Etsy, an e-commerce platform, implemented a strategy
              called "Renewable Electricity" to reduce its environmental impact.
              They have optimized their technology infrastructure and have
              worked on the efficient design of their servers to improve energy
              efficiency. In addition, they have invested in renewable energy to
              power their operations and data centers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Microsoft Project Natick:</b> Microsoft has carried out an
              innovative project called Natick, in which they developed
              underwater data centers to reduce energy consumption for cooling.
              Submerging data centers in the ocean reduces cooling costs and
              uses natural resources to maintain the proper temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Google:</b> Google has been committed to sustainability in
              programming and in its infrastructure of cloud services. They have
              implemented energy optimization algorithms in their data centers
              and have worked on the energy efficiency of their services to
              reduce resource consumption.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Microsoft:</b> Microsoft has been focused on reducing its
              carbon footprint and has announced plans to be "carbon negative"
              by 2030. They have explored new ways to design and run data
              centers more efficiently and are investigating how scheduling can
              contribute to a greater sustainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Uber Movement:</b> Uber launched the "Uber Movement" platform
              that uses trip data to help cities make more informed
              transportation planning decisions. This can result in a reduction
              in traffic and in the emission of greenhouse gases.
